Analyzing metagenomes with STAMP
================================

.. include:: ../global.rst

`STAMP <http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/STAMP>`_ (Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles) is a software package for analyzing metagenomic profiles. A user friendly, graphical interface permits easy exploration of statistical results and generation of publication quality plots for inferring the biological relevance of features in a metagenomic profile.

STAMP takes as input two data files. The first is a ``profile file`` that contains the count data, and the second is an optional ``group metadata file`` that contains metadata about each of the samples to allow comparison of groups (e.g. sick vs healthy). 

The ``group metadata file`` will need to be created by yourself, but is a simple tab-delimited format that can be easily exported from a spreadsheet program. The first column must have sample ids that match the ``profile file`` with each of the other columns representing different metadata about the samples.

An example ``group metadata file`` could look like this::

    Sample Id    Location    Phenotype    Gender    Sample Size
    Sample 1     Canada        Obese      Female      4000
    Sample 2     Canada        Lean       Male        2000
    Sample 3     Italy         Lean       Female      3000 

To create the STAMP ``profile file`` you need to do a simple conversion of PICRUSt's BIOM output from within the STAMP tool. Start up STAMP and click ::

    File->Create STAMP profile from...->BIOM profile

Click "Load" and select the predicted_metagenomes.biom file from PICRUSt. Then do one of the following:: 

1) If this is the output from ``predict_metagenomes.py`` script then leave the Metadata field as ``<observation ids>``. This will allow comparison of KEGG Orthologs.

2) If this is the output from ``categorize_by_functions.py`` script then change the Metadata field to ``KEGG_Pathways``. This will allow comparison of KEGG Pathways.

Then click "Create STAMP profile" and save as a new file with ".spf". 

Once you have your STAMP ``profile file`` and ``group metadata file`` generated, load the files from the **File->Load Data...** menu and start browsing your data. 

The `STAMP User's Guide <http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/wow/images/0/02/STAMP_Users_Guide_v2.0.0.pdf>`_ is very clear and helpful. 

With only a few clicks you can generate figures like these:
